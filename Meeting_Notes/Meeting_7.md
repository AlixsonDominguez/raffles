### 🗒️ **Notes**:

- Out of the three user stories, we came to the conclusion that our top priority is user story number 1. That user story will involve the raffle system itself. The other two are important but not crucial at this moment. 
- We, as a team, know what we want to do but are unsure how to approach it. 
- We still aren't sure how to split the workload amongst the 5 of us.
- There is a template on Android Studios we believe fits our needs.
- We decided to meet in-person on 10/24/23 to come up with a blueprint of how we will approach the assignment.
