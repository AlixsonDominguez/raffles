### 🗒️ **Notes**:

- Brainstorming ideas for a name
- Still undecided on a possible name
- The team will be looking into learning JavaScript and Android Studio
- No one on the team has built an app before, so we will all be looking into frontend and backend frameworks
- For a database, we will most likely go with MySQL since a few members of the team are currently learning it
- We will be looking into apps similar to what we want to build to see what we feel confident building and implementing
- This meeting was rather short but necessary before heading into sprint 3
