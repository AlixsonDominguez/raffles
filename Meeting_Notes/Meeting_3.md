### 🗒️ **Notes**:

- **Raffle System**
  - Need pictures of the different products.
  - Sorting algorithm for picking winners and losers.
  - Need a captcha to avoid "bots".
  - As a team we believe it will be the simplest to code.

- **Language App**
  - Similar to duolingo
  - Focuses on dialects for different Spanish countries.
  - Our team has 2 people who speak Spanish.
  - Targeting a younger demographic.
  - Most likely the easiest to code.
  - The downside is that it will likely take a while to get all the recordings for the words available on the app.
  - No one on the team has used a language learning app so we have nothing to compare it to.

- **Pet Sitter App**
  - Calendar that allows you to schedule a sitter and see different sitters' availability.
  - A way to pay on the app.
  - Monitor progress.
  - No one on the team has used a pet sitter app before so we have nothing to compare to.

- **Mental Health App**
  - Make an anonymous profile.
  - A type of forum.
  - Links to talk to professionals or view informational videos.
  - Journal for the user to write down their thoughts throughout the week.
  - Live chat may be difficult to accomplish.
  - Report system.
  - Organize calendars.
  - No other apps we can compare to.

Towards the end of the meeting we decided we are going to build the sneaker raffle app.
