## Product Scenarios

### Product Scenario 1

Scenario: A collector of limited edition shoes, Arya Morris wishes to receive a pair of the new Jumpshoe 11’s, which have just been released on the market so she can add to her large collection of Jumpshoe's she already has.

### Product Scenario 2

- John Doe, is an older gentleman who has never bought any sneakers in his lifetime. He wanted to surprise his grandson with a pair of new sneakers.

### Product Scenario 3

- Jasmine Alverez is a 16-years-old high school student who is soon going back to school. She wants to buy a new pair of sneakers for the upcoming school year.
Since Jasmine wants to have a lot of options to choose from, she decides to use our app. Jasmine enters her email and password to login. 
Upon logging in, she chooses to take a look at some of the sneakers in the raffle section. The sneakers she 
finds are slightly pricier than she’d like and the release dates would be cutting it close to the new school year. To avoid the risk of losing a raffle 
and not having a pair of sneakers for the first day of school, Jasmine goes to browse the sneakers that are in stock. She eventually 
finds a pair that she likes. She clicks on them and types in her information before confirming her purchase. 

## User Stories

### Feature 1: Raffle System

**Description**

- The raffle system is the main feature of our app, and will provide an equal opportunity to every user who enters the raffle. 
This will allow anyone who has a user account to enter the raffle for a chance to acquire limited edition shoes that are highly sought after. 
The app will send PUSH notifications 15, 10, and 5 minutes before the raffle opens. Only after the time has finished will the raffle be 
available to enter, for a set amount of time depending on the raffle.

**User Story 1**

- A collector of limited edition shoes becomes aware of a new release of a highly desired pair of sneakers on the market.
Unfortunately, everywhere they look the shoes are sold out; until they find out that our app has 10 in stock, only available through our raffle system. 
While this is not a guarantee, the collector decides to try his luck in our fair raffle, and is reminded just as the raffle is about to begin.
He receives the shoes he wanted fairly, as he was chosen as one of the 10 to gain the ability to purchase.

**Constraints**

- While we strive to make the app as fair as possible, it is extremely difficult to get rid of bots altogether. 

**Comments**

- Users can only enter a raffle one time; establishing a proper defense against any work-arounds to this rule is essential to maintain a fair experience.


### Feature 2: Purchasing outside of the raffle

**Description**

The app is geared towards making the experience of purchasing sneakers a simple and easy process. The app allows users to purchase sneakers by simply adding
them to cart. The app also provides information on release dates/times of sneakers and option to purchase items as gifts (receives gift receipts)

**User Story 2**

John Doe, is an older gentleman who has never bought any sneakers in his lifetime. 
He wanted to surprise his grandson with a pair of new sneakers and heard that our app was the best and easiest to use.
