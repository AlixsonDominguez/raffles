## Executive Summary

The aim of Sole Seeker is to revolutionize the world of sneaker raffles by creating equal opportunities for its user base. We will accomplish this through various security and verification practices set up to prevent the usage of bots in our raffles. The success of this app could lead all the way up to integration with major brands within the industry. Ultimately we want to bring the power back to the user, from the hardcore sneaker enthusiasts all the way to the casual student who just wants a chance at the hot new pair on the market. 

## Product Vision

For sneaker enthusiasts who want to buy their desired pairs of sneakers, the Sole Seeker app is a mobile application that allows users to enter sneaker raffles and make purchases from a selection of already-released sneakers. Unlike other sneaker raffle apps, our app aims to give everyone a fair chance at winning raffles by focusing our attention on bot prevention

## Vision Statement

The increase in popularity of limited edition sneakers provides us with the opportunity to create a necessary alternative to current sneaker raffle applications that are on the market. We will offer a fair and easy-to-use raffle system that can provide users with the opportunity to gain access to sought-after sneakers. Our idea is to create a “bot-less” product that is void of automated accounts that will provide certain individuals with a higher chance of winning the raffles.

## Product Vision Board

Bots is a software application that runs automated tasks over the internet. In raffle apps, bots are being used to create fake profiles to gain more entries in these raffles giving a disadvantage to other customers. The purpose of developing this raffle app is to construct a more equitable process for raffling off high-demand merchandise to customers by counteracting the use of “bots”.

### Target audience:
- Sneaker Enthusiasts
- Students

### Raffe app will prevent the use of bots through security measures such as:
- Implementing the use of a Captcha system
- Extra verification steps (email/number verification)
- Other key features:
- Time-specific attendance for entry into the raffle

## Risks
Preventing bots from participating in the raffles can require more than one method and even then cannot always guarantee a 100% bot-free app. There is the risk of winners not receiving their order (this can be due to a wrong address or the shipping company losing the order). With sensitive information given by users, extra precautions must be taken to ensure that their information cannot be stolen or leaked.
