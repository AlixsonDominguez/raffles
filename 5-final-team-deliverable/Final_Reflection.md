## Product Vision

- **Product Vision Statement:** Replace this with your refined product vision statement.

## Learning and Growth Journey

### Reflection

Reflect on your journey in learning software engineering through concrete scenarios:

1. **Team Collaboration Approach:**
   Describe how your team used tools like Slack and Trello to coordinate tasks. Share an example of how assigning tasks in Trello helped streamline your group projects and fostered effective communication.
    - **Devin:** Utilized Microsoft Teams to coordinate and meet with one another throughout the entire semester. It allowed us to also share information like helpful YouTube videos to assist with issues we had or if we did not know where to start.
    - Used Trello to delegate tasks to team members and provide each other with a better understanding of our progress throughout the semester.
    - Took advantage of GitHub's features and shared/expanded upon each other's code throughout the semester to work off of one another.

2. **Challenges and Overcoming Them:**
   Recall a specific challenge, like debugging a code issue together. Explain how you collaborated to identify the bug's source and successfully resolved it. This experience showcases your problem-solving and teamwork skills.
    - **Devin:** When it came to the later part of the semester, there were many cases of us all getting onto teams and having meetings about the best way to merge. We would work through the errors that came up, like our raffle system not working with the payment screen together.

3. **Accomplishments and Pride:**
   Highlight a feature you contributed to, such as creating a login system. Discuss how your combined skills enabled the team to deliver a functional feature that enhances user experience.
 - **Devin:** Working together we were able to create a login system. The UI aspect and part of the functionality was done by Chayenne and the authentication to Firebase was done by me, so a user would have a successful and secure login.
 - 
      
4. **Learning and Growth:**
   Provide an example of how you applied a concept learned in class to a practical scenario. Describe how you used version control (like Git) to collaborate on a coding assignment, improving code organization and collaboration.
 - **Devin:** Trello allowed me to update team members of progress when working with Firebase and the login for our app. My team members could see at a glance what I had progressed with, as well as what I was doing/stuck on throughout the development process.

## Product Showcase

### Elevator Pitch

Summarize your product's value proposition with relatable examples. For instance, explain how your app's streamlined user interface improves navigation for users, enhancing their overall experience.

_Meet Sole Seeker, your passport to hassle-free sneaker wins! With a seamless user journey, start by creating an account effortlessly. Once in, our sleek login screen welcomes you to a curated selection of exclusive sneakers. Are you eady to elevate your sneaker game? Enter the raffle, and if you're the lucky winner, securely purchase your dream sneakers right within the app. No frills, just thrills â€“ that's Sole Seeker, your go-to for a straightforward path to coveted sneaker victories. Step into style, step into Sole Seeker._

### Product Demo

Share simple examples of your product's functionality:

- **Example 1:** The user login accesses Firebase to authenticate our users, ensuring that the person accessing the account is the correct individual.
- **Example 2:** When the user clicks on a shoe with a release date they are brought to that shoe's screen. The countdown timer will display how long until the shoe releases, as well as how long it is until the raffle closes and denies entry.
- **Example 3:** When the user enters a raffle, they are given a number. If that number matches the winning number then they are informed through a pop up and can purchase the shoe directly from the pop up screen.

### Technical Architecture Overview

Simplify a technical concept with an example:

- **Example 1:** Explain the client-server architecture by comparing it to a waiter taking orders (client) and a kitchen preparing food (server).
- **Example 1:** To login to our system, our app is connected to Firebase Authentication (server). The user must type in their username and password into our application (client) and it is verified when the data is sent to the server.
- **Example 2:** 


### Codebase Exploration

Illustrate a coding concept with a relatable analogy:

- **Example 1:** If the release date AND raffle end date AND release time AND raffle end time are not empty, a countdown timer is set up. If the current time is less than the release date time, it displays the time until the release date. If the current time is less than the raffle end time, it displays the time until the raffle will close. Otherwise, the raffle end time has passed the application displays that the dates have passed.

### Access Your Work

- **[Presentation Slides](link-to-presentation):** Share a link to your final presentation slides.
- **[Source Code Repository](link-to-repo):** Provide access to your source code repository.
- **Other Materials:** Include links to diagrams or documents you created for your project.

## Final Reflection Presentation

- **Duration:** 25-minute minimum, 40-minute maximum

## Career Readiness Assessment

Answer the following questions with practical examples:

1. **Team Collaboration Skills:** Reflect on a time when coordinating with team members improved a project's outcome or efficiency.
   - **Devin:** Meeting with Chayenne while we built the login screen was essential for me to successfully incorporate my code into hers, and make sure that what I coded worked with her code such as checking if an email was valid, but also make that email be communicated correctly to Firebase for authentication.
3. **Problem-Solving Abilities:** Share a situation where you had to troubleshoot a technical issue and how you approached the problem-solving process.
   - **Devin:** I had never worked with UI before, just backend work. I took some example XML files from StackOverflow and pasted them into ChatGPT and had it explain the code to me, which allowed me to fully grasp how I could build UI within the application and make necessary edits.
5. **Contributions to the Project:** Discuss a specific task you contributed to and how your involvement positively impacted the project's development.
   - **Devin:** Setting up the time/date for group meetings and ensuring everybody was available and kept up to speed was a way I helped foster communication with my group mates.
7. **Applied Knowledge:** Describe a technical concept learned in class that you've used in your project, highlighting its practical relevance.
8. **Adaptability and Learning:** Provide an example of a challenge you faced that required learning a new skill or concept, and how you adapted to overcome it.
   - **Devin:** At first the idea of working with a database was a daunting task, as I was responsible for finding a way to authenticate users. In order to overcome it, I looked at YouTube videos and used StackOverflow to understand not only how to connect the database, but also how to add/remove and authenticate users for our login system. I also learned at the very beginning how to build a database (albeit in very simple terms) by communicating from the app to the database with code.
