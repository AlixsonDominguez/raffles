**What went well?**

- Brainstorming our ideas and collaborating with one another to come up with various ideas and avenues we can do research on to see the viability of the products.
- We had good communication with one another and developed a solid understanding of our basic responsibilities and when we should be meeting.

**What did not go well?**

- Not everyone showed up to the second meeting.
- We were initially unsure of how to approach the project and what to discuss at our first meeting.

**How can we improve?**

- We can improve by having more communication throughout the week on Teams.
- Everyone attending the meetings if possible.

Overall, this has been an effective first week and will likely only continue to get better.
